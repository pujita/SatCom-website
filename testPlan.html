                <h3>Ground Data Collection Sites</h3>
                <p>Ground stations are to be located in Seattle, WA, Columbus, OH and Atlanta, GA. These stations are proposed to have both the transmitter and receiver described in the hardware description so that they can also achieve the goals laid forth in Part 2. These locations were chosen for their differences in latitude, longitude and Rain Climate Zones within the Continental United States (CONUS.) Furthermore, atmospheric sensors for pressure, humidity, etc. are to be placed near the communication dishes at these locations and logged for correlation with communication link data. </p>

                <h3>Clear Day Link Margin and Signal</h3>
                <p>Frequencies of operation for the beacon transmitter on the satellite are to be tuned between 71GHz and 76GHz. As shown the Link Budget calculations at 71GHz and 76GHz, the system has a Clear-day CNR of 46.37dB and 45.77dB respectively; more than adequate for meeting the clear-day link margin minimum threshold proposed. By making the transmit and receive frequencies of the system tunable based on programming over the lower frequency communications link, the ability to characterize the Signal Attenuation, Phase Distortion and Depolarization at a multitude of frequencies is possible during one testing event.</p>

The final stage amplifier of the proposed transmitter design is a TWT with an output power of 40dBm combined with an antenna with a gain on of 51.4dBi leads to the EIRP used. </p>

                <h3>Signal Attenuation</h3>
                <p>Measurement of Signal Attenuation is to be characterized by comparing the signal amplitude received and logged by the DSP on the receiver at the ground station during a Clear-Day condition and comparing this value to the measurements taken with varying weather conditions at all locations. By doing this many times for both clear day and conditions and for the different weather conditions a table of attenuations can be generated.</p>

                <h3>Phase Distortion</h3>
                <p>Phase distortion measurements will be completed by monitoring the In Phase and Quadrature components of the signal going into the DSP block of the receiver and comparing them to those generated at the transmitter. Both of the software defined radio of the transmitter and the DSP block of the receiver are to be locked to GPS timing and time stamped. By doing so, the difference in phase and compensating for the phase difference created by the signal having travelled from the transmitter to the receiver, the phase distortion of the channel can be found. In order for this testing scheme to work, the full gain and phase behavior of both the transmitter and the receiver must be characterized for all frequencies tested.</p>

                <h3>Depolarization</h3>
                <p>Measurement of depolarization is to be completed by taking advantage of the ground station receiver having two antennas; one polarized for vertical polarization while the other one is horizontal. By switching between the two antennas and monitoring the amplitude and phase of the signal received for both states, it is proposed that the amount of depolarization of the original vertically polarized signal can be found. This process is to be completed for Clear-day conditions to calculate a baseline depolarization and then repeated for various weather conditions.</p>

                <p>As many of the procedures to test these characteristics can be done simultaneously, a rigorous Design of Experiments (DoE) analysis will be completed to define the minimum number of tests that can be completed that will fully characterize the atmospheric effects of a wide range of weather conditions on the link. Tests will be repeated will similar weather, polarization, and signal level as necessary to rigorously test the validity of data.  This data proposed to then by used in modeling software created to predict results of future testing; the results of this software simulation is to be compared with the aforementioned test results for accuracy.</p>
