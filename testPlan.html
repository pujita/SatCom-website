By making the transmit and receive frequencies of the system tunable based on programming over the lower frequency communications link, the ability to characterize the Signal Attenuation, Phase Distortion and Depolarization at a multitude of frequencies is possible during one testing event.</p>

By doing so, the difference in phase and compensating for the phase difference created by the signal having travelled from the transmitter to the receiver, the phase distortion of the channel can be found. In order for this testing scheme to work, the full gain and phase behavior of both the transmitter and the receiver must be characterized for all frequencies tested.</p>

By switching between the two antennas and monitoring the amplitude and phase of the signal received for both states, it is proposed that the amount of depolarization of the original vertically polarized signal can be found. This process is to be completed for Clear-day conditions to calculate a baseline depolarization and then repeated for various weather conditions.</p>

                  <h3>Signal Bandwidth/ Data Rate</h3>
                  <p>The proposed initial modulation scheme of the communications link to be implemented is Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK). Using BPSK with a Bit Error Rate (BER) of 0.0001 the clear day link margins for various Data Rates were calculated; these can be seen in detail in the Link Budget section. The maximum calculated theoretical bit rate with BPSK and the chosen BER for a Clear-day link is 164 Mb/s, as the System Link Margin (SML) of all frequencies in both uplink and downlink is greater than 0dB. The next larger calculated value of 328 Mb/s would not have a positive SML for all values of downlink frequencies, and would have a negative link margin for all uplink frequencies. With this in mind, the maximum capacity of this proposed system has been found for clear day situations. Knowing this, testing will occur at various lower Data Rates where the link margin for Clear-day operations is much higher, thus allowing for reception of data even with atmospheric losses. </p>
